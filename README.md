Welcome to our data science tutorial for CMSC320! 

This tutorial walks through the entire data science pipeline: data curation, parsing, and management; exploratory data analysis; hypothesis testing and machine learning; and the 
curation of a message covering insights gained through the tutorial. 

We will be comparing the salary of various locations in the United States to the cost of living in those 
areas. We will also be developing a regression model that predicts salary based on years of experience, role, and location. The goal is to see what cities are the most 
cost-effective to live in based on these factors.
